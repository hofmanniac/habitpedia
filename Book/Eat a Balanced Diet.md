## What is a Balanced Diet, Anyway?

Okay, so what's the deal with a balanced diet? Is it all about eating boring, bland foods and never indulging in your favorite treats? Absolutely not! A balanced diet is all about finding a healthy balance that works for you and your body. It's not about following a strict set of rules, but rather about eating a variety of nutrient-rich foods from all food groups in the right proportions. A balanced diet can help you get all the nutrients you need to grow, develop, and stay healthy, as well as give you energy to participate in activities you enjoy and feel your best.

So, what does a balanced diet look like in practice? It's different for everyone, depending on your age, gender, lifestyle, and activity level. But in general, a balanced diet should include a mix of the following food groups:

- Fruits: These tasty treats are packed with vitamins, minerals, and fiber, and come in a wide variety of colors and flavors. Aim to eat at least 2 servings of fruit per day (that's about a cup or two).

- Vegetables: These might not always be the most exciting food, but they're loaded with nutrients and fiber, and come in many different forms, from leafy greens to root veggies to cruciferous veggies. Aim to eat at least 3 servings of vegetables per day (that's about a cup or two).

- Grains: These provide energy and important nutrients like B vitamins and iron. Choose whole grains like whole wheat, oats, quinoa, or brown rice for added fiber. Aim for at least 6 servings of grains per day (that's about 3-4 ounces).

- Proteins: These are essential for building and repairing tissues, and can come from plant-based sources like beans and legumes, or animal-based sources like meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy. Aim for at least 2 servings of protein per day (that's about 3-4 ounces).

- Dairy: These are a good source of calcium, protein, and other nutrients, and can come in the form of milk, cheese, yogurt, or other dairy products. Aim for at least 3 servings of dairy per day (that's about a cup or two).

Remember, a balanced diet is not about perfection, but about finding a healthy balance that works for you. It's okay to indulge in your favorite treats from time to time, as long as you're also eating plenty of nutritious foods to keep your body happy and healthy.

## Nutrient-Rich Foods

Okay, so what are nutrient-rich foods, and why should we care about them?

Nutrient-rich foods are foods that are packed with nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and fiber, and are often low in calories and high in nutrients. These foods are important because they help our bodies function properly, and provide us with the energy and nutrients we need to grow, develop, and stay healthy.

By including nutrient-rich foods in our diets, we can help prevent nutrient deficiencies, reduce the risk of chronic diseases, and maintain a healthy weight. So, what are some examples of nutrient-rich foods?

Here are a few examples from each food group:

- Fruits: Apples, oranges, bananas, berries, melons, kiwis, mangoes, pineapples, plums, peaches, pears, apricots, guavas, papayas, passionfruit, figs, raisins, prunes, dates, and more!

- Vegetables: Leafy greens (spinach, kale, collards, romaine lettuce, arugula, etc.), cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, etc.), root vegetables (carrots, beets, sweet potatoes, potatoes, turnips, etc.), squashes (pumpkin, acorn squash, butternut squash, etc.), tomatoes, peppers, onions, garlic, and more!

- Grains: Whole wheat, oats, quinoa, brown rice, barley, bulgur, farro, and other whole grains are rich in nutrients like B vitamins, iron, and fiber. Choose whole grains over refined grains whenever possible, as they are higher in nutrients and fiber and can help with digestion. Experiment with different types of grains to mix up your meals, such as quinoa in a grain bowl or farro in a salad. You can also add grains to your breakfast routine, such as oats in your yogurt or whole grain toast with your eggs. Try incorporating grains into your main meals, such as using quinoa as a base for a grain bowl or adding whole wheat pasta to your soup. Yum!

- Proteins: Lean cuts of meat (such as chicken, turkey, and pork), fish (such as salmon, tuna, and cod), shellfish (such as shrimp, scallops, and lobster), beans (such as kidney beans, black beans, and lentils), tofu, tempeh, and more!

- Dairy: Milk, cheese, yogurt, and other dairy products made from low-fat or fat-free milk (such as skim milk, 1% milk, and fat-free yogurt).

Remember, it's important to choose nutrient-rich foods over less healthy options whenever possible, but it's also important to find a balance and enjoy a variety of foods. It's all about finding a healthy balance that works for you and your body."

## Making It Real

## Pitfalls

Okay, so we've talked about the importance of eating a variety of nutrient-rich foods, but what about overindulging in unhealthy foods? Can you have too much of a bad thing? Well, unfortunately, the answer is yes. While it's okay to indulge in your favorite treats from time to time, it's important to remember that unhealthy foods are often high in calories, sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats, and can contribute to weight gain, nutrient deficiencies, and chronic diseases if consumed in excess.

That being said, it's important to remember that moderation is key. It's okay to indulge in your favorite unhealthy foods from time to time, but it's also important to pay attention to portion sizes and make sure you're not eating these foods all the time. If you're feeling satisfied and energized after a meal, you're probably on the right track. But if you're feeling stuffed or sluggish, you may want to adjust your portions or choose healthier options for your next meal.

So, how can you make sure you're not overindulging in unhealthy foods? Here are a few tips:

- Pay attention to portion sizes: Use measuring cups, a food scale, or your hand to estimate portion sizes. This can help you avoid overeating, especially if you're not sure how much you should be eating.
- Choose healthier options: Instead of reaching for unhealthy snacks, try choosing healthier options like fruit, vegetables, or whole grains. These options are often lower in calories and higher in nutrients, and can help you feel satisfied without overindulging.
- Balance your meals: Make sure you're including a variety of nutrient-rich foods from all food groups in your meals, and aim for a balance of protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats. This can help you feel satisfied and energized, and reduce the temptation to overindulge in unhealthy foods."

## Gamifying

Here are a few ideas for tracking and gamifying #1 (eating a variety of nutrient-rich foods):

- Create a "food rainbow": Each day, try to include a variety of foods from different colors and food groups in your meals and snacks. You can track your progress by creating a visual "food rainbow" with pictures or stickers of the foods you've eaten. The goal is to have as many colors represented as possible each day.

- Play "food bingo": Create a bingo board with different squares representing different foods from different food groups (for example, one square could be "fruit," another could be "vegetables," etc.). Each day, try to include a variety of foods from the different squares in your meals and snacks. When you've included a food from a particular square, mark it off on your bingo board. The goal is to get a bingo (all squares marked off) as often as possible.

- Have a "taste test" challenge: Each week, try a new food from a different food group that you've never tried before. You can track your progress by keeping a list of the new foods you've tried. The goal is to try as many new foods as possible and expand your taste buds.

- Create a "nutrition tracker": Use a nutrition tracker app or website to track the nutrients you're consuming each day. The goal is to make sure you're getting enough nutrients from a variety of sources and not relying on just a few types of foods.

- Have a "snack swap" challenge: Each week, challenge yourself to swap out an unhealthy snack for a healthier one. You can track your progress by keeping a list of the healthy snacks you've tried. The goal is to find healthier snack options that you enjoy and can incorporate into your routine.
