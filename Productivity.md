# Productivity

## Become a morning person

- Start going to bed earlier
- Set out warm, comfy clothes the night before
- Set out a glass of water and drink it first thing in the morning before getting out of bed
- Do something fun or creative first thing in the morning, play a video game, read, work on a personal project, etc.
