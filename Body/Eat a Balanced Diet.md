# Overview

Eating a balanced diet is an important part of maintaining good health and preventing a range of chronic diseases. A balanced diet includes a variety of different types of foods from all the food groups, in the right amounts, to provide the nutrients your body needs to function properly. This includes a mix of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. It is important to choose whole, unprocessed foods whenever possible and limit your intake of added sugars, salt, and unhealthy fats. Eating appropriate portion sizes that are tailored to your age, gender, weight, and activity level is also important. If you are unsure of how to create a balanced diet that meets your needs, consider working with a registered dietitian or nutritionist.

## Include a variety of foods

A balanced diet should include a variety of different types of foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. This helps ensure that you are getting all of the nutrients that your body needs to function properly.
