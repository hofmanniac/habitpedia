# Overview

Eating a balanced diet is an important part of maintaining good health and preventing a range of chronic diseases. A balanced diet includes a variety of different types of foods from all the food groups, in the right amounts, to provide the nutrients your body needs to function properly. This includes a mix of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. It is important to choose whole, unprocessed foods whenever possible and limit your intake of added sugars, salt, and unhealthy fats. Eating appropriate portion sizes that are tailored to your age, gender, weight, and activity level is also important. If you are unsure of how to create a balanced diet that meets your needs, consider working with a registered dietitian or nutritionist.

## Include a variety of foods

A balanced diet should include a variety of different types of foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. This helps ensure that you are getting all of the nutrients that your body needs to function properly.

## Limit added sugars and unhealthy fats

It's important to be mindful of the types of foods that you are eating and to limit those that are high in added sugars and unhealthy fats. These types of foods can contribute to weight gain and increase the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes.

## Choose whole grains over refined grains

Whole grains, such as oats, quinoa, and brown rice, are a healthier choice than refined grains like white bread, pasta, and rice. They are higher in fiber and other nutrients and have been linked to a lower risk of chronic diseases.

## Stay hydrated

Drinking enough water is important for maintaining good health. Aim to drink at least 8-8 ounces of water per day, or more if you are physically active or in a hot environment.

## Limit processed and fast food

Processed and fast foods are often high in added sugars, unhealthy fats, and calories, and can be lacking in essential nutrients. Limiting these types of foods can help you maintain a healthy weight and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.

## Eat at regular intervals

Eating at regular intervals can help you maintain a healthy weight and keep your energy levels stable throughout the day. Aim to eat small, frequent meals and snacks rather than waiting until you are excessively hungry.

## Plan ahead and be mindful of portion sizes

Planning ahead and being mindful of portion sizes can help you make healthier choices and avoid overindulging. Consider packing your own lunches and snacks and using measuring cups or a food scale to help with portion control.
